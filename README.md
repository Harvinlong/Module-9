# Seaside Resort Shop Analysis
## Purpose of this project: 
Using the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Steps
I wrote a query that filtered the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. I then converted the June temperatures to a list and created a DataFrame from that list.

Next, I generated summary statistics for the June temperatures DataFrame. Finally, I ran the code in my SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb file and confirmed that the summary statistics matched the provided image.

And I also did the analysis to the data in December
